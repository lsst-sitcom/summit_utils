class BlockInfo:
    """Information about the execution of a "block".

    Each BlockInfo instance contains information about a single block
    execution. This is identified by the block number and sequence number,
    which, when combined with the dayObs, define the block ID.

    Each BlockInfo instance contains the following information:
        * The block ID - this is the primary identifier, as a string, for
          example "BL52_20230615_02", which is parsed into:
            * The block number, as an integer, for example 52, for "BLOCK-52".
            * The dayObs, as an integer, for example 20230615.
            * The seqNum - the execution number of that block on that day.
        * The begin and end times of the block execution, as astropy.time.Time
        * The SAL indices which were involved in the block execution, as a list
        * The SITCOM tickets which were involved in the block execution, as a
          list of strings, including the SITCOM- prefix.
        * The states of the script during the block execution, as a list of
          ``ScriptStatePoint`` instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    blockNumber : `str`
        The block number, as a str - sometimes it'll be like 123 but others it
        will be like "T123" for test blocks.
    blockId : `str`
        The block ID, as a string.
    dayObs : `int`
        The dayObs the block was run on.
    seqNum : `int`
        The sequence number of the block.
    begin : `astropy.time.Time`
        The time the block execution began.
    end : `astropy.time.Time`
        The time the block execution ended.
    isTestCase : `bool`
        Whether this block is a test case type block, or a regular block. This
        is also reflected in the blockNumber.
    salIndices : `list` of `int`
        One or more SAL indices, relating to the block.
    tickets : `list` of `str`
        One or more SITCOM tickets, relating to the block.
    states : `list` of `lsst.summit.utils.blockUtils.ScriptStatePoint`
        The states of the script during the block. Each element is a
        ``ScriptStatePoint`` which contains:
            - the time, as an astropy.time.Time
            - the state, as a ``ScriptState`` enum
