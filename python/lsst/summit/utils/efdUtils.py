    `raiseIfTopicNotInSchema` should only be set to `False` when running on the
    summit or in utility code for topics which might have had no data taken
    within the last <data_retention_period> (nominally 30 days). Once a topic
    is in the schema at USDF it will always be there, and thus users there
    never need worry about this, always using `False` will be fine. However, at
    the summit things are a little less predictable, so something missing from
    the schema doesn't necessarily mean a typo, and utility code shouldn't
    raise when data has been expunged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client : `lsst_efd_client.efd_helper.EfdClient`
        The EFD client to use.
    topic : `str`
        The topic to query.
    columns : `list` of `str`, optional
        The columns to query. If not specified, all columns are queried.
    prePadding : `float`
        The amount of time before the nominal start of the query to include, in
        seconds.
    postPadding : `float`
        The amount of extra time after the nominal end of the query to include,
        in seconds.
    dayObs : `int`, optional
        The dayObs to query. If specified, this is used to determine the begin
        and end times.
    begin : `astropy.Time`, optional
        The begin time for the query. If specified, either a end time or a
        timespan must be supplied.
    end : `astropy.Time`, optional
        The end time for the query. If specified, a begin time must also be
        supplied.
    timespan : `astropy.TimeDelta`, optional
        The timespan for the query. If specified, a begin time must also be
        supplied.
    event : `lsst.summit.utils.efdUtils.TMAEvent`, optional
        The event to query. If specified, this is used to determine the begin
        and end times, and all other options are disallowed.
    expRecord : `lsst.daf.butler.dimensions.DimensionRecord`, optional
        The exposure record containing the timespan to query. If specified, all
        other options are disallowed.
    warn : bool, optional
        If ``True``, warn when no data is found. Exists so that utility code
        can disable warnings when checking for data, and therefore defaults to
        ``True``.
    raiseIfTopicNotInSchema : `bool`, optional
        Whether to raise an error if the topic is not in the EFD schema.

    Returns
    -------
    data : `pd.DataFrame`
        The merged data from all topics.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        If the topics are not in the EFD schema.
    ValueError:
        If both a dayObs and a begin/end or timespan are specified.
