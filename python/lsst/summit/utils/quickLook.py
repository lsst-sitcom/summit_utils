        Parameters
        ----------
        ccdExposure : `lsst.afw.image.Exposure`
            The raw exposure that is to be run through ISR.  The
            exposure is modified by this method.
        camera : `lsst.afw.cameraGeom.Camera`, optional
            The camera geometry for this exposure. Required if
            one or more of ``ccdExposure``, ``bias``, ``dark``, or
            ``flat`` does not have an associated detector.
        bias : `lsst.afw.image.Exposure`, optional
            Bias calibration frame.
        linearizer : `lsst.ip.isr.linearize.LinearizeBase`, optional
            Functor for linearization.

            Calibration for crosstalk.
        crosstalkSources : `list`, optional
            List of possible crosstalk sources.
        dark : `lsst.afw.image.Exposure`, optional
            Dark calibration frame.
        flat : `lsst.afw.image.Exposure`, optional
            Flat calibration frame.
        ptc : `lsst.ip.isr.PhotonTransferCurveDataset`, optional
            Photon transfer curve dataset, with, e.g., gains
            and read noise.
        bfKernel : `numpy.ndarray`, optional
            Brighter-fatter kernel.
        bfGains : `dict` of `float`, optional
            Gains used to override the detector's nominal gains for the
            brighter-fatter correction. A dict keyed by amplifier name for
            the detector in question.
        defects : `lsst.ip.isr.Defects`, optional
            List of defects.
        fringes : `lsst.pipe.base.Struct`, optional
            Struct containing the fringe correction data, with
            elements:
            - ``fringes``: fringe calibration frame (`afw.image.Exposure`)
            - ``seed``: random seed derived from the ccdExposureId for random
                number generator (`uint32`)
        opticsTransmission: `lsst.afw.image.TransmissionCurve`, optional
            A ``TransmissionCurve`` that represents the throughput of the,
            optics, to be evaluated in focal-plane coordinates.
        filterTransmission : `lsst.afw.image.TransmissionCurve`
            A ``TransmissionCurve`` that represents the throughput of the
            filter itself, to be evaluated in focal-plane coordinates.
        sensorTransmission : `lsst.afw.image.TransmissionCurve`
            A ``TransmissionCurve`` that represents the throughput of the
            sensor itself, to be evaluated in post-assembly trimmed detector
            coordinates.
        atmosphereTransmission : `lsst.afw.image.TransmissionCurve`
            A ``TransmissionCurve`` that represents the throughput of the
            atmosphere, assumed to be spatially constant.
        detectorNum : `int`, optional
            The integer number for the detector to process.
        strayLightData : `object`, optional
            Opaque object containing calibration information for stray-light
            correction.  If `None`, no correction will be performed.
        illumMaskedImage : `lsst.afw.image.MaskedImage`, optional
            Illumination correction image.
        isrBaseConfig : `lsst.ip.isr.IsrTaskConfig`, optional
            An isrTask config to act as the base configuration. Options which
            involve applying a calibration product are ignored, but this allows
            for the configuration of e.g. the number of overscan columns.

        Returns
        -------
        result : `lsst.pipe.base.Struct`
            Result struct with component:
            - ``exposure`` : `afw.image.Exposure`
                The ISRed and cosmic-ray-repaired exposure.
